\textbf{Lasso}

\textsc{understanding:} Can you explain the effect that Lasso has on the weights and which reguralizer you would chose to get the best results possible?

\textsc{answer:} Lasso leads to very sparse weights. Sparsity means that many of the coefficients of the weights $w_i$ are zero. This causes less computation and makes the solution more interpretable. The best reguralizer for Lasso is the $L_1$-reguralizer, since it is a reguralizer that provides sparse weights and still remains convex.
